Betting strategy
  - Each bet should not be on the day of the game.
  - If one penalty prediction is high, you loose all the points 
  - if one penalty prediction is low or equal to the goals you get the points
  - Add the ability for the system to generate random entry for each tip entry.
  - At the cut off time, generate a random entry for tips that are unfilled. This should happen for only or at most 5 matches.
